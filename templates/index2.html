    <div class="disease-info">
      <h2>Tomato___Bacterial_spot</h2>
      <p>Bacterial spot is caused by several species of the bacterium Xanthomonas. It manifests as small, water-soaked spots on leaves, which eventually turn brown and may be surrounded by a yellow halo. The disease thrives in warm, wet conditions and can lead to significant yield loss. In severe cases, the spots coalesce, causing large areas of dead tissue. Fruits can also be affected, showing raised, rough spots, which make them unmarketable.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Use disease-free seeds and transplants. Rotate crops and avoid planting tomatoes in the same location year after year. Implement proper spacing to improve air circulation. Apply copper-based bactericides, such as copper hydroxide or copper sulfate, as a preventive measure. Control weeds and remove plant debris to reduce bacterial sources.</p>

    <div class="disease-info">
      <h2>Tomato___Early_blight</h2>
      <p>Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It is characterized by dark, concentric rings on older leaves, which eventually turn yellow and drop. The disease can also affect stems and fruits, leading to significant defoliation and reduced fruit quality and yield. Early blight typically starts on lower, older leaves and progresses upward, and it can cause collar rot in seedlings and stem lesions in older plants.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Practice crop rotation and avoid planting tomatoes in the same location for at least two years. Use resistant varieties if available. Ensure good spacing and pruning for adequate air circulation. Apply fungicides, such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb, regularly and remove infected plant debris from the field.</p>

      <h2>Tomato___healthy</h2>
      <p>CONGRALUTIONSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!. Your healthy tomato plant has vigorous growth with dark green leaves, a robust stem, and well-formed, blemish-free fruits. There are no signs of disease, pests, or nutrient deficiencies. Proper care, including adequate watering, fertilization, and pest control, helps maintain plant health. Healthy tomato plants produce high yields of quality fruits and are more resilient to environmental stresses and disease pressures.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Implement integrated pest management practices. Regularly monitor plants for signs of stress or disease. Maintain proper soil fertility and pH levels. Water plants consistently and mulch to retain soil moisture. Use disease-resistant varieties and ensure good garden hygiene.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="disease-info">
      <h2>Tomato___Late_blight</h2>
      <p>Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. It appears as water-soaked lesions on leaves, which rapidly turn brown and black, often accompanied by a white, fuzzy growth on the undersides. Stems and fruits can also be affected, leading to a rapid collapse of the plant. This disease is notorious for causing the Irish potato famine and can spread quickly under cool, moist conditions.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Use resistant varieties and certified disease-free seeds. Remove and destroy infected plant material. Apply fungicides preventatively, such as those containing chlorothalonil or copper, especially in wet conditions. Practice crop rotation and avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on foliage.</p>

    <div class="disease-info">
      <h2>Tomato___Leaf_Mold</h2>
      <p>Leaf mold, caused by the fungus Passalora fulva, shows as pale green or yellow spots on the upper side of leaves, with a velvety, olive-green mold on the underside. It primarily affects older leaves and can lead to leaf drop and reduced photosynthesis. The disease thrives in high humidity and poor air circulation, often occurring in greenhouse or densely planted environments.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Ensure good ventilation and avoid overhead irrigation to reduce humidity levels. Use resistant varieties if available. Apply fungicides, such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb, if necessary, and remove infected leaves to limit disease spread. Practice crop rotation and proper spacing.</p>

      <h2>Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot</h2>
      <p>Septoria leaf spot, caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, is characterized by small, circular spots with dark borders and gray centers on lower leaves. The disease causes premature leaf drop, reducing plant vigor and yield. Septoria leaf spot thrives in warm, wet weather and can spread rapidly under such conditions.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Use disease-free seeds and resistant varieties. Ensure adequate spacing for good air circulation. Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Apply fungicides, such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb, as needed and avoid overhead watering. Practice crop rotation.</p>

    <div class="disease-info">
      <h2>Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite</h2>
      <p>Two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) are tiny pests that cause stippling on leaves, which can become bronzed and dry. Severe infestations can lead to defoliation and reduced plant vigor. They thrive in hot, dry conditions and can reproduce rapidly, leading to large populations in a short time.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Regularly monitor and inspect plants for early signs of mites. Use miticides, such as abamectin or bifenazate, or insecticidal soaps. Maintain adequate humidity and water stress levels. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and predatory mites. Remove heavily infested leaves.</p>

    <div class="disease-info">
      <h2>Tomato___Target_Spot</h2>
      <p>Target spot, caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola, presents as small, dark spots with concentric rings on leaves, stems, and fruits. Severe infections can cause extensive defoliation and fruit rot, significantly impacting yields. The disease can spread rapidly in warm, humid conditions, leading to large areas of necrotic tissue on affected plants.</p>
      <hr>
<p>Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation. Ensure proper plant spacing and prune for better air circulation. Apply fungicides, such as chlorothalonil or azoxystrobin, as needed. Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce the spread of the pathogen.</p>

  <img src="static/Images/9.JPG" alt="Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus">
</div>
<div class="disease-info">
  <h2>Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus</h2>
  <p>Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) causes mottling and mosaic patterns on leaves, which can be distorted and stunted. Infected plants exhibit reduced growth and yield. The virus is highly contagious and spreads through contaminated tools, hands, and plant debris. Infected fruits may show uneven ripening and internal browning.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Use virus-free seeds and transplants. Disinfect tools and hands after handling infected plants. Remove and destroy infected plants. Practice good garden hygiene and crop rotation. Avoid smoking around tomato plants as tobacco can carry the virus. Use insecticidal oils or soaps to control aphids, which can spread the virus.</p>

<div class="disease-info">
  <h2>Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus</h2>
  <p>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is transmitted by whiteflies and causes upward curling and yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit set. Infected plants often produce poor-quality fruits and suffer significant yield loss. The virus can spread rapidly, especially in warm climates where whiteflies are prevalent.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Use resistant varieties and control whitefly populations with insecticides, such as imidacloprid or pymetrozine, or biological controls. Implement reflective mulches to repel whiteflies. Remove and destroy infected plants. Use row covers to protect young plants from whitefly exposure.</p>
