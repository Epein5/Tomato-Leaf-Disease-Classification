# Tomato Leaf Classification with Dockerization and Azure Deployment

This is a project on Tomato leaf classification with dockerization and deployment in Azure.

Our classes are:

- Tomato___Bacterial_spot
- Tomato___Early_blight
- Tomato___healthy
- Tomato___Late_blight
- Tomato___Leaf_Mold
- Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot
- Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite
- Tomato___Target_Spot
- Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus
- Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus

## How to set up

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tomato-leaf-classification.git
2. Install the requirements using the `requirements.txt` file:


       pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create the following folders:
   - `Datasets`: This folder will contain your dataset.
   - `ML`: This folder is where you should add your ML model.

4. Download the dataset from [Tomato Leaf Disease Detection on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf) and place it in the `Datasets` folder.

5. Correct the paths to the Datasets and train the Model using the code in ML/train.ipynb.

6. Add your ML model to the `ML` folder and change the paths in the code to point to your model.

7. Navigate to the main directory and run the following command to start the application:

       uvicorn BACKEND.main:app
   
Now you should be able to access the API on your web browser on:

      http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

8. If you want to dockerize the the application download and install docker in your desktop run the following command in the terminal.

          docker build -t <your_docker_image_name> .
   
10. Now you can create the docker container manually through the docker desktop or run the command in the terminal to run the container:

           docker run -p 8000:8000 <your_docker_image_name>

11. To publish on the docker hub.

    First Create a new docker tag using the following command:
    
           docker tag <your_docker_image_name> <your_username>/<your_docker_image_name>:v1.0

    Then push the tag to the docker hub:

           docker push <your_docker_image_name>/<your_docker_image_name>:v1.0

12. Now your docker image is ready to be shared and hosted in different platforms
